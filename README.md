# **My GA WDI Portfolio, by Vikas Garg**

# **User Story**

Hello! My name is <strong>Vikas Garg</strong> and I'm a finance entrepreneur developing a foundation in programming so I can learn some new skills and take my ideas to the next level!<br><br>
From March - June 2017, I was enrolled in General Assembly's full-time Web Development Immersive program in Singapore. The fast pace and immense volume of material covered made for an extremely challenging 3 months, but I'm proud to have made it through with some great new skills to continue developing. I completed several independent and team projects during the course.<br><br>
Please visit a few of my featured projects! Thank you!
